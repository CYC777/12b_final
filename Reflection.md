2. it should be able to save data to a file and load it back.  
It can save file and load it back, the file contains all the circles with parameters and keep their orders

5. what you would do if you had more time...  
	* Create an abstract class for all shapes, let the circles to inherit the shape class and create more subclass like square, oval, triangle and points. 
	* Enabling reading and drawing on image, output the drawing to image. 
	* Beautify the UI
